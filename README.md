-- Cognitive Load Redistribution Agent --

An Agentic Wellness System for Detecting and Redistributing Invisible Cognitive Labor in Women

🌍 Overview

Modern wellness and productivity systems often assume burnout is caused by poor habits or lack of motivation. However, for many women, the root cause is chronic invisible cognitive load — the continuous mental effort involved in planning, remembering, coordinating, anticipating, and emotionally managing tasks.

This invisible cognitive labor is:

Rarely quantified

Unevenly distributed

Often misinterpreted as low discipline or low energy

As a result, existing systems frequently add more tasks instead of reducing mental burden, accelerating burnout rather than preventing it.

The Cognitive Load Redistribution Agent addresses this gap by detecting cognitive overload, reasoning about its causes, and recommending task simplification or redistribution through an agentic decision-making loop.

🎯 Target Users & Use Cases
Target Users

Women students and professionals

Women managing multiple roles (academics, work, caregiving)

Users experiencing burnout, chronic fatigue, or habit collapse

Use Cases

Early detection of cognitive overload

Understanding why routines fail despite effort

Reducing mental strain through task simplification

Preventing burnout via proactive intervention

🤖 Why an Agentic System?

This problem cannot be solved with static rules or a simple chatbot because:

Cognitive load changes daily

Overload emerges from patterns over time

The system must decide when to intervene and when not to

Trade-offs must be made under limited attention and energy

An agentic system enables:

Continuous observation

Context-aware reasoning

Decision-based interventions

Adaptive behavior over time

The goal is not prediction accuracy, but ongoing reasoning and decision-making.

🧠 Agent Design
Primary Agent: Cognitive Load Agent

Goals

Minimize sustained cognitive overload

Preserve user wellbeing and habit consistency

Prevent burnout escalation

Constraints

Limited user attention

Ethical boundaries (non-clinical, decision-support only)

Avoid over-intervention or decision fatigue

Responsibilities

Estimate intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load

Detect overload conditions

Decide whether to simplify, chunk, defer, or take no action

Explain decisions transparently

🔁 Agent Reasoning Workflow

Observe
User provides task descriptions representing current workload and mental demand.

Analyze
The agent derives cognitive load indicators using interpretable heuristics and computes:

Intrinsic load

Extraneous load

Germane load

Plan
The agent evaluates thresholds and decides whether to:

Simplify tasks

Chunk tasks

Defer low-impact components

Take no action

Act
The system presents:

Simplified task instructions (if required)

Agent decisions and reasoning

A cognitive relief checklist

Adapt
Subsequent inputs may reflect reduced load, demonstrating adaptive behavior over time.

🧪 Implementation Details
Cognitive Load Estimation

Heuristic-based, interpretable model

Weighted contributions with bounded ranges

Normalized cognitive load score (0–100)

Decision Logic

Rule-based and state-aware

LLM usage is gated and invoked only when simplification is required

Prevents unnecessary intervention and hallucination

LLM Usage

Open-source summarization model (free tier)

Used only for task simplification

Output is sanitized and converted into bullet-point checklists

🧾 Cognitive Relief Checklist

In addition to task simplification, the system provides optional cognitive offloading suggestions such as:

Breaking tasks into smaller steps

Deferring non-urgent components

Writing things down instead of remembering

Reducing expectations for overloaded tasks

These suggestions reduce mental burden without adding new obligations.

⚠️ Ethical Considerations & Limitations
Limitations

Relies on self-reported task descriptions

Simplified cognitive load estimation

Does not replace medical or mental health care

Ethical Framing

Decision-support only

No diagnosis or prescriptive enforcement

User retains full control over actions

🚀 Setup & Execution
Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn api:app --reload

Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

Environment Variables

🔮 Future Improvements

Longitudinal cognitive load tracking

Calendar or wearable integration

Multi-agent negotiation (health vs work agents)

Personalized intervention strategies
